        "title": "How I transitioned from Chemical Engr'n to Software Engr'n",
        "body": "Have you ever dreamed of pivoting into the world of software engineering? \n Samson Okeji, a result-driven Chemical Engineering graduate certainly hadn't… that is, until he took his first programming class online on a curated programme organized by Google via Pluralsight. Now he's a full-time software engineer at Firston Technologies, a fin-tech solutions provider. 'I never would've thought that I would do this when I graduated college,' he explains, laughing. Even when he took his first programming class (ironically, one sponsored by his employer at the time), he didn't expect it would lead to a career change: 'It was just something fun. I enjoyed doing it and was pleasantly surprised when I realized I wasn't horrible at it.'That realization blossomed into something more when his job as a chemical engineer was no longer offering him the kinds of technical challenges he craved. 'I thought software engineering might be more technical and problem-solving focused,' he says. But even though he was already an engineer by trade, the idea of transitioning into software engineering scared him. His family and friends helped him overcome the insecurities he felt ('will this work?' 'am I good enough?') and with their support, he decided to go all in: he quit his job to attend coding bootcamp full-time. Not long afterwards, in 2022, he landed his job at Firston Technologies. According to Samson, looking back on the transition now, 'It was the best decision I've ever made.'"

        "title": "Software Engineering Early career Experience!",
        "body": "When I started, I came in as a 'new grad' alongside people who were straight out of college, even though I had a couple of years of work experience, so I did notice that I had certain communication and professional skills that they hadn't developed yet. Those skills have really helped me at Firston. Another thing that helped with the transition is that Firston doesn't have super formal levels or titles, so as a software engineer, you have a lot of input in deciding what you work on and what you try. It's been really good for me because I've been able to say, 'I'm not sure if I'm qualified for this, but it sounds really interesting,' and team members have encouraged me to try new things and supported me along the way."

        "title": "A Better way to plan your Career!",
        "body": "This process begins with the choices you make at school. You want your education to provide you with the necessary skills and expertise to succeed in a wide variety of jobs. This means that you need to make smart choice about the courses you will follow. I favor those that involve extensive writing, rigorous analysis, or quantitative skills. Once you have finished your formal education, search for jobs that will allow you to further expand your transferable knowledge — to help you find your next job. Let’s say you take a job putting together airplane leases. Within a few years, you could become the world’s expert on the subject; however, this narrow expertise probably won’t help you in any other line of work. By contrast, if you take a job that will expand your computer programming skills, you can greatly boost your options for later steps in your career."
